# Continental Warfare

## A Multiplayer Format for Magic: The Gathering

### Overview
Continental Warfare is a free-for-all Magic: The Gathering format for 5 or more players. It simulates the experience of battling across distant continents, where each player faces the immediate threats on their borders but remains aware of the unseen dangers beyond. The last player standing becomes the Emperor.

## Key Rules

1. **Targeting Restrictions:**
   - You can only target the players directly to your left and right with spells, abilities, or attacks.
   - You cannot target players who are not your immediate neighbors. This applies to player-targeting effects as well as spells and abilities that affect opponents' permanents.
   - Global effects (like "each opponent" or "each player") only affect the players directly to your left and right, as they are considered your "opponents." Players beyond your immediate neighbors remain unseen and unaffected.

2. **Attack Rules:**
   - You can only declare attacks against the players directly to your left and right.
   - Creatures with "must attack" effects must still attack an adjacent player if able.

3. **Elimination:**
   - When a player is eliminated, the circle closes. The two players who were adjacent to the eliminated player now become each other's new neighbors.
   - This may open up new targets for spells, abilities, and attacks.

4. **Winning the Game:**
   - The last remaining player is declared the Emperor and wins the game.

5. **Optional House Rules:**
   - **Mercenaries Rule:** Players may be allowed to make temporary alliances with neighbors, but betrayal is always an option.

## Strategy Tips
- **Control Your Borders:** Focus on the immediate threats posed by the players next to you.
- **Plan for the Future:** Consider how eliminating one player will change your neighbor's position.
- **Timing is Everything:** You may want to delay finishing off a neighbor if it means a stronger player will become your new opponent.
- **Negotiate Carefully:** Alliances may help you survive, but be ready for betrayal.

## Summary
Continental Warfare offers a fresh take on Magic: The Gathering multiplayer formats. By limiting each player's influence to their immediate neighbors, the game creates an intense sense of localized conflict while maintaining the looming threat of unseen enemies beyond. The last player standing is crowned Emperor of the battlefield.
